# Using the If-Then-Else Statement

Chris owns an auto repair business and has several employees. If an employee works over 40 hours in a week, Chris pays that employee 1.5 times his or her regular hourly pay rate for all hours over 40. Chris has asked you to design a simple payroll program that calculates an employee’s gross pay, including any overtime wages. You design the following algorithm:
```
Get the number of hours worked.

Get the hourly pay rate.

If the employee worked more than 40 hours, calculate the gross pay with overtime. Otherwise, calculate the gross pay as usual.

Display the gross pay.
```
You go through the top-down design process and create the hierarchy chart shown in Figure 4-10. As shown in the hierarchy chart, the main module will call four other modules. The following are summaries of those modules:

Figure 4-10 Hierarchy chart

```
getHoursWorked—This module will ask the user to enter the number of hours worked.

getPayRate—This module will ask the user to enter the hourly pay rate.

calcPayWithOT—This module will calculate an employee’s pay with overtime.

calcRegularPay—This module will calculate the gross pay for an employee with no overtime.
```
The main module, which executes when the program is run, will call these modules and then display the gross pay. The pseudocode for the program is shown in Program 4-2. Figures 4-11 and 4-12 show flowcharts for each of the modules.

#  Program Output (with Input Shown in Bold)
Enter the number of hours worked.
## 40 [Enter] 
Enter the hourly pay rate.
## 20 [Enter] 
The gross pay is $800

# Program Output (with Input Shown in Bold)
Enter the number of hours worked.
## 50 [Enter] 
Enter the hourly pay rate.
## 20 [Enter] 
The gross pay is $1100
Notice that two global constants are declared in lines 2 and 3. The BASE_HOURS constant is set to 40, which is the number of hours an employee can work in a week without getting paid overtime. The OT_MULTIPLIER constant is set to 1.5, which is the pay rate multiplier for overtime hours. This means that the employee’s hourly pay rate is multiplied by 1.5 for all overtime hours.
