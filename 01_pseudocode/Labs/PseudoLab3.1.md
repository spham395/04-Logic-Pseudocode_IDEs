1. Design an If-Then statement (or a flowchart with a single alternative decision structure) that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the variable z if the variable x is greater than 100.

2. Design an If-Then statement (or a flowchart with a single alternative decision structure) that assigns 0 to the variable b and assigns 1 to the variable c if the variable a is less than 10.

3. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that assigns 0 to the variable b if the variable a is less than 10. Otherwise, it should assign 99 to the variable b.

4. The following pseudocode contains several nested If-Then-Else statements. Unfortunately, it was written without proper alignment and indentation. Rewrite the code and use the proper conventions of alignment and indentation.
```
If score < 60 Then
Display "Your grade is F."
Else
If score < 70 Then
Display "Your grade is D."
Else
If score < 80 Then
Display "Your grade is C."
Else
If score < 90 Then
Display "Your grade is B."
Else
Display "Your grade is A."
End If
End If
End If
End If
```
5. Design nested decision structures that perform the following: If amount1 is greater than 10 and amount2 is less than 100, display the greater of amount1 and amount2.

6. Rewrite the following If-Then-Else If statement as a Select Case statement.
```
If selection == 1 Then
   Display "You selected A."
Else If selection == 2 Then
   Display "You selected 2."
Else If selection == 3 Then
   Display "You selected 3."
Else If selection == 4 Then
   Display "You selected 4."
Else
   Display "Not good with numbers, eh?"
End If
```
7. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that displays “Speed is normal” if the speed variable is within the range of 24 to 56. If speed holds a value outside this range, display “Speed is abnormal.”

8. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that determines whether the points variable is outside the range of 9 to 51. If the variable holds a value outside this range it should display “Invalid points.” Otherwise, it should display “Valid points.”

9. Design a case structure that tests the month variable and does the following:

* If the month variable is set to 1, it displays “January has 31 days.”

* If the month variable is set to 2, it displays “February has 28 days.”

* If the month variable is set to 3, it displays “March has 31 days.”

* If the month variable is set to anything else, it displays “Invalid selection.”

10. Write an If-Then statement that sets the variable hours to 10 when the flag variable minimum is set.
