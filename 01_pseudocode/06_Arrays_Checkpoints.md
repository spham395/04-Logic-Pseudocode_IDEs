8.1 Can you store a mixture of data types in an array?

8.2 What is an array size declarator?

8.3 In most languages, can the size of an array be changed while the program is running?

8.4 What is an array element?

8.5 What is a subscript?

8.6 What is usually the first subscript in an array?

8.7 Look at the following pseudocode and answer questions a through d.
```
Constant Integer SIZE = 7
Declare Real numbers[SIZE]
```
* What is the name of the array that is being declared?

* What is the size of the array?

* What data type are the array elements?

* What is the subscript of the last element in the array?

8.8 What does “array bounds checking” mean?

8.9 What is an off-by-one error?

8.10 What is a search algorithm?

8.11 Which array element does the sequential search algorithm first look at?

8.12 What does the loop do in the sequential search algorithm? What happens when the value being searched for is found?

8.13 How many elements does the sequential search algorithm look at in the case that the search value is not found in the array?

8.14 How do you look for a partial string match when searching an array of strings for a value?

8.15 Briefly describe how you calculate the total of the values in an array.

8.16 Briefly describe how you get the average of the values in an array.

8.17 Describe the algorithm for finding the highest value in an array.

8.18 Describe the algorithm for finding the lowest value in an array.

8.19 How do you copy the contents of one array to another array?

8.20 How do you establish a relationship between the data stored in two parallel arrays?

8.21 A program uses two parallel arrays: names and creditScore. The names array holds customer names and the creditScore array holds customer credit scores. If a particular customer’s name is stored in names[82], where would that customer’s credit score be stored?

8.22 How many rows and how many columns are in the following array?
```
Declare Integer points[88][100]
```
8.23 Write a pseudocode statement that assigns the value 100 to the very last ­element in the points array declared in Checkpoint 8.22.

8.24 Write a pseudocode declaration for a two-dimensional array initialized with the following table of data:
```
12   24   32   21   42
14   67   87   65   90
19    1   24   12    8
```
8.25 Assume a program has the following declarations:
```
Constant Integer ROWS = 100
Constant Integer COLS = 50
Declare Integer info[ROWS][COLS]
```
Write pseudocode with a set of nested loops that stores the value 99 in each element of the info array.

8.26 A bookstore keeps books on 50 racks with 10 shelves each. Each shelf holds 25 books. Declare a 3D String array to hold the names of all the books in the store. The array’s three dimensions should represent the racks, shelves, and books in the store.
