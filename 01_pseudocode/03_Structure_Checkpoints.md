 if-else
4.10 When you write an If-Then-Else statement, under what circumstances do the statements that appear between Else and End If execute?  
  when condition is false  
4.11 If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?

If "z" < "a" Then
   Display "z is less than a."
Else
   Display "z is not less than a."
End If
```  
  "z is not less than a."  
4.12 If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?

4.14 What statement do you use in pseudocode to write a dual alternative decision structure?

4.15 When you write an If-Then-Else statement, under what circumstances do the statements that appear between the Else clause and the End If clause execute?

4.16 Convert the following pseudocode to an If-Then-Else If statement:
```
If number == 1 Then
   Display "One"
Else
   If number == 2 Then
      Display "Two"
   Else
      If number == 3 Then

End If
```
4.17 What is a multiple alternative decision structure?

4.18 How do you write a multiple alternative decision structure in pseudocode?

4.19 What does the case structure test, in order to determine which set of statements to execute?

4.20 You need to write a multiple alternative decision structure, but the language you are using will not allow you to perform the test you need in a Select Case statement. What can you do to achieve the same results?

4.21 What is a compound Boolean expression?

4.22 The following truth table shows various combinations of the values true and false connected by a logical operator. Complete the table by circling T or F to indicate whether the result of such a combination is true or false.
