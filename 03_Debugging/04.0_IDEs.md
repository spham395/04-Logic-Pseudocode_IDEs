# Using an IDE

For this lesson, we are going to dive into using an IDE to debug. The IDE we will be using is **Visual Studio**.

## Visual Studio

When setting up Visual Studio for coding/debugging, a few steps to be accomplished first.
* Open Visual Studio
* Click `File -> New -> Project`
* For our C Programs, choose `Visual C++` on the left side
* Click `Empty Project` in the middle window
* Give your project a name and press `OK`

There are multiple `tool windows` within the standard Visual Studio workspace that we need to discuss.

### Solution Explorer

Solution explorer is located on the right side of the screen.  It contains all of our project files:  References, external dependencies, header files, resource files, and source files.

Source files are created in the source directory and header files in the header directory.
**Note:** You can add new directories as you wish and place other files where you choose.

### Properties Window

This window contains details about an item that we clicked on in the solutions window. Details include information such as name, UID, location, etc.

* New Project

* Save All
* Type of Build (debug, release, etc)
* Platform
* Build+Run button

These choices are also available via kepboard shortcuts or dropdown menus.

### Output Window

The output window is located just below the code window. The output window displays tasks that are occuring within the build. It displays compiling errors and is used for debugging your code.
